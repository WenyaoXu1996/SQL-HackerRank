Type of Triangle
==
*note*：
1. first we need to determine whether three lines meet the condition of a triangle
2. then we use case when then to separate these situations


    select  
       case when A+B>C and A+C>B and B+C>A then
                  case when  A = B AND B = C then 'Equilateral'
                       when A = B OR B = C OR A = C then 'Isosceles'
                       else 'Scalene'
                  end
            else "Not a Triangle"
       end
    from triangles

The PADS
==
*note*：concat + substring + lower
1. how to use substring(column,start_position,len)
2. lower used to get all lowercase of each occupation name
3. substring can be replaced with left(Occupation,1)


    select concat(Name,'(',Substring(Occupation,1,1),')') as N
    from occupations
    Order by N
    select concat('There are a total of ',count(occupation),' ',lower(occupation),'s.') as total
    from occupations
    group by occupation
    order by total

==
*note*：

    set @r1=0, @r2=0, @r3=0, @r4=0;
    select min(Doctor), min(Professor), min(Singer), min(Actor)
    from(
      select case when Occupation='Doctor' then (@r1:=@r1+1)
                  when Occupation='Professor' then (@r2:=@r2+1)
                  when Occupation='Singer' then (@r3:=@r3+1)
                  when Occupation='Actor' then (@r4:=@r4+1) end as RowNumber,
         case when Occupation='Doctor' then Name end as Doctor,
         case when Occupation='Professor' then Name end as Professor,
         case when Occupation='Singer' then Name end as Singer,
         case when Occupation='Actor' then Name end as Actor
      from OCCUPATIONS
      order by Name
    ) Temp

Binary Tree Nodes
==
*note*：

    select N, case
    when P is NULL then "Root"
    when (select count(*) from BST where P =B.N)>0 then "Inner"
    ELSE "Leaf"
    end
    from BST as B
    order by N
